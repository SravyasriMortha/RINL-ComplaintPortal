# RINL-ComplaintPortal
 This website was done as part of my summer-23 training at RINL Steel plant - a govt PSU. The website helps employees to register different types of civil complaints noticed at their workplace. The data is collected in a NoSQL database MongoDB and is given access to the head of the concerned departments.
